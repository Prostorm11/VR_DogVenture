VR Word Puzzle Game

A Virtual Reality (VR) word puzzle game developed in Unity Hub, where players solve increasingly difficult word challenges while interacting with an emotionally reactive dog companion.

Project Overview

The VR Word Puzzle Game is an immersive educational puzzle experience built for VR headsets. Players create meaningful words from a given base word to score points and advance through levels. A virtual dog companion reacts dynamically to player performance—becoming happy when the player succeeds and angry when the player fails.

The game combines learning, fun, and emotional feedback to create an engaging VR experience.
